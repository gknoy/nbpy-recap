# Recap of North Bay Python conference

These slides are a summary of my notes on (some) of the most interesting presentations from the North Bay Python conference (December 2-3 2017).

I originally wrote this for a presentation for my team at work, and time constraints prevented me from including all of the talks at the conference.

### Other resources

The North Bay Python conference has a Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLc1vUexbRTlRBJcUG9U6ug) which has videos of most (all?) of the talks, as well. :)

### Usage

You can view these slides by running:

```
npm install

remarker
```

This will run a server on `localhost:8081` showing the slide presentation. Slides can be navigated via the arrow keys.
